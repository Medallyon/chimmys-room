# Chimmy's Room
A small interactive platformer/adventure to explore Chimmy's Room - A pink and lavish experience. Play as Meddy, a tiny infiltrator, to hike through Chimmy's room and collect as many PomPoms as possible!

What started out as a level design project turned out to become a pretty neat, small indie platformer. This project still mainly serves as a display of level design, but with some interactive elements to it. It is supposed to showcase my ability to put together a complete level using a multitude of pre-existing asset libraries as well as custom game mechanics.
